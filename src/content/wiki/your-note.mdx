# Your Sample Note

This is a sample wiki note that demonstrates how backticks in titles should be handled.

## Code Examples

Here's some sample code:

```javascript
const message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message);
```

## Notes

- The title contains `backticks` that should be stripped in the UI
- This helps with cleaner navigation and display
- The content can still use backticks normally
