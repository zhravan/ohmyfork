The navigation bar randomly disappeared under specific conditions that were hard to pin down initially.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Log in as a user with name starting with 'M'
2. Wait for Tuesday
3. Navigate to any page
4. Observe disappearing navigation bar
5. Refresh the page (navigation returns)
6. Wait 5 minutes (navigation disappears again)

## Solution

- Renamed CSS classes to avoid third‑party collisions (BEM)
- Removed date‑based conditional styling
- Scoped styles properly to the component
