Forms submitted automatically at 3:33 AM with no user activity or reliable client fingerprints.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Deploy contact form to production
2. Wait until 3:33 AM (any timezone)
3. Check form submission logs
4. Entries appear with missing IP/Userâ€‘Agent

## Solution Ideas and Mitigations

- Potential automated tests in prod
- Bot submissions with spoofed timestamps
- Misconfigured cron task
- Possible XSS injection

Mitigations considered and/or applied: CAPTCHA, rate limiting, origin validation, a honeypot field, and enhanced logging.
